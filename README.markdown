# My emacs config

The idea and organization for this is shamelessly stolen from @crnixon's emacs.d. It is an attempt (so far a very poor one) at having a literate emacs config [github.com/crnixon/emacs.d]. I'll work on the literate part once I finish the part where things actually work the way I want them to.

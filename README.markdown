# My emacs config

The idea and organization for this is shamelessly stolen from
[@crnixon's emacs.d](http://github.com/crnixon/emacs.d). It is an attempt (so
far a very poor one) at having a literate emacs config. Since github
doesn't render org-mode files all that well, I pushed an
[html exported version](http://abedra.github.com/emacs.d) to a pages
branch.
